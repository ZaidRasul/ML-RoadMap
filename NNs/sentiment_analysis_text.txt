[general] foreign it's really a great pleasure and an honor to address this wonderful and highly prestigious forum future investment initiative a great version of his Royal Highness Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and this speaks volumes about his vision and forward-looking great mechanism of his future how his right highness the Crown Prince wishes to see not only Saudi Arabia as a great country in times to come but also involving other regions of the world to move forward with speed and become countries where men and women are empowered where progress and prosperity is the order of the day.

[policy] ladies and gentlemen it is the guiding principle of environment social and governance which constitute the right combination and perhaps even the prison to look at and assess the world of today and tomorrow.

[action] nothing could be more important to us than this very challenge how to ensure that our Collective tomorrow is better than ours today and that we are ready for it that we have the tools skills and Technology which enables us not just to navigate the complex World of Tomorrow but to also shape it today in a manner that has the most beneficial impact on Humanity.

[development] we are living through truly transformational times throughout history such times have triggered political social environmental and economic changes these changes have been powered by imagination Innovation and action yes gold decisive and consequential action.

[general] but the pace of transformation and change was never as Swift as it is today with the power of Technology driving the world towards a future that only few could imagine in the past.

[development] we are well positioned to harness the Dynamics of change tech power is a great equalizer it can cut through social cultural and financial barriers and Empower those who are equipped to leverage it.

[people] in Pakistan I have seen with a sense of great satisfaction how young women and men are crafting their carriers like I have seen here today here in Riyadh what a wonderful site where men and women are working together for the good of mankind and their prosperity and happiness and boosting their earning Power by using Tech in diverse field within the larger digital metrics like e-commerce microcity to learn and Fascination from technology has led to close interaction with such experts.

[governance] serving as the chief minister of Punjab Anna film pakistanabad I saw the fruits of my policies when I introduced Tech Innovations in the educational Health sectors.

[welfare] using technology we provided conditional cash transfers to school girls stipends supported specially abled people gave timely agricultural inputs to Farmers provided free laptops in hundreds of thousands to deserving and high performing students established a high-tech safe City in the city of Lahore which is the capital of Punjab in Pakistan set up smart schools introduce digital technology in our immunization program and linked markets for more Equitable buying and selling.

[development] ladies and gentlemen I believe Pakistan is uniquely placed to leverage this change we have one of the youngest population in the world most of these youngsters are equipped with the tools of the new digital world they are hungering for more skills and more opportunities their talent is already recognized Pakistan is the fourth most popular for free launching country.

[finance] ladies and gentlemen consider this combination a large and young digital Savvy population and a massive unmet demand that simply cannot be addressed through existing means of production today a family in urban and rural Pakistan has access to mobile phones and internet as far as to high education standards wants to buy consumer products and needs everything from insurance to Health Care.

[finance] the importance of this huge demand can I am sure be well appreciated and recognized by investors and entrepreneurs present here.

[general] I have deep confidence in this young generation of pakistanis this is why I am fully prepared to invest our scarce resources of my government in providing them with enabling environment for Innovation.

[environment] while technology is unleashing new potentials our world is also undergoing cataclysmic changes global warming is upon us extreme temperatures over time are changing weather patterns and disrupting the usual balance of Nature and our ecosystem.

[environment] countries like Pakistan with negligible carbon emissions less than one percent are vulnerable to the adverse impact of climate change.

[development] Pakistan experienced historic heat wave in March this year and torrential rains from June to August which led to devastating floods in Pakistan and the province of synth Balochistan KP and general Punjab they were all inundated by flood waters and this was not because of our making it was purely climate change induced.

[welfare] therefore the north the northern Globe has to appreciate and understand that the countries which have become or becoming victim of climate induced torrential devastation should be supported and given due Health in terms of technology in terms of design to have strong robust infrastructure whether it's Zara it's agriculture or industry or any other field of undertaking.

[welfare] the rain and floods in Pakistan has affected 33 million people and more than 1700 people have died including infants children more than two million houses have been damaged and over three and a half million Acres of crops have been lost.

[action] we will stand on our own feet we will work hard we will work hard inshallah entiringly and we are extremely grateful to our brotherly countries and friendly countries including Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and my very respective brother my either his Royal Highness Prince Muhammad Salman created air bridge between Saudi Arabia and Islamabad and Karachi sending food items tents and other very important item for flood affected people.

[cooperation] we are very grateful to our brothers in Saudi Arabia and we are deeply utilized for this very timely support.

[development] ladies and gentlemen as society's Place greater premium on sustainability clean energy is the driver of the new economy looking back my Administration in the province of Punjab was exploring solar power in 2012 we established 1 000 solar power Park in bhavalpur which is south of Lahore it is since producing 400 megawatts with spare capacity to generate the balance.

[development] as prime minister of Pakistan I am leading from the front for the development of ashraal of 10 000 megawatts of solar power to meet Pakistan's Peak load demands.

[finance] Pakistan because when we import oil at these and gas at these exorbitant prices around the globe Pakistan which is a developing country cannot afford to finance the import Bill to the extent of 24 billion dollars billion dollars our economy cannot afford therefore we have alhamdulillah a lot of sun over there in Balochistan in Punjab and send and so we have launched a program of ashara aleph megawatts of karabamanal Shams in Pakistan.

[development] and we are upgrading a rail ports Airways water gas power and digital infrastructure with a young and growing population the market is expanding our government is encouraging private Enterprises to drive the economy.

[finance] the government is investing in public goods these two are available for partnership so public private partnership.

[cooperation] and I would like to I would like to propose to my brothers and sisters sitting here from Saudi Arabia and other countries and globally that here is an opportunity where the world wants to have green energy where we want to avoid pollution and minimize our our problems in the air and the answer is that is the future and for that I'm here standing before you inviting you to please come forward.

[general] and I as prime minister of Pakistan but at this very very important Forum I am telling you very frankly this wonderful Gathering and wonderful Arrangements has pleasantly surprised me it has been a wonderful occasion to be here.

[general] I have been to such Summits and conferences around the globe but this is Davis in desert it is a remarkable achievement by our Saudi friends and Saudi corporations and Saudi young leadership headed by conference Muhammad bin Salman.

[development] my dear friends my brothers and sisters Pakistan has many higher educational institutions some are recognized internationally.

[development] I propose therefore that the future investment initiative should consider establishing a satellite Center in one of Pakistan's leading universities to explore the rapidly growing Pakistani market and spur Innovation among our young population.

[development] the satellite could become the center of a network of researchers innovators investors and service providers to harness the capacities which if optimized would take Pakistan to a higher level of Social and economic development.

[governance] let me assure you as the Chief Executive Officer of Pakistan today that we as a nation are ready to reach out to all of you and entire globe and find potential investors and grab the future with both hands.

2. [welfare] The members of the are up board and one third of the complex Ram that the guests have given a proverb in rural Gujarat and Assalam Alaikum that today is for me, this is not happiness and that respect for Intihai is amazing, my pain has reduced that I have a.  
3. [development] This was the last year of every year, I have been invited to such people that such people, who are very strange Pakistanis, that God is the Church and Allah Taala has blessed them with a great cruelty, but they take the risk and earn this red money.  
4. [development] These play a vital role in the progress and prosperity of the community, but they also include those Dalits who are white-collared and who are in perfect condition because of their hard work every day.  
5. [policy] That I get grains or this is the less, God is the judge which we get to read at various places in Quran Kareem and those who have implemented them, in the true sense, when are both the religion and the world coming here too?  
6. [general] They will hit the alarm in the house of heaven and in the next wherever they go, love will come to them.  
7. [general] Greater than this, I understand that this habit and respect cannot be a job destination.  
8. [general] The fact is that it was in 2013 that I met him at that time, sir.  
9. [corruption] And Iqbal has proved to be a spendthrift and I already knew him for some time and I was also aware of his good name.  
10. [action] Now he told me that you have to make Bilochi and Ravya too, definitely see this work of the minister.  
11. [general] Why were there any spices in it that would make a person get resolved?  
12. [action] So I said, of course, Chawla, I am here for that.  
13. [welfare] He also told me that we are a hospital here and we want to cook dal for 16 nights in the path of Allah Taala.  
14. [general] I did a lot.  
15. [general] It is a matter of happiness but I said that I have a condition, what should I do?  
16. [disaster management] I said that in the flood of 2000, 10, 11, 12, 2010 and 11, when the people of Turkey are pure politics and today, sir, many scholars have.  
17. [disaster management] Of Muzaffargarh, which was completely submerged during the flood days, there was so much devastation in the ponds of Dera Ghazi Khan and other areas that even today, when that picture comes to mind and heart, a person becomes helpless, so I said.  
18. [healthcare] I look at that year he deserves 60 beds but it is state of the art go all over Pakistan and yes bath will be good for him yo yo and where Shaukat Khan will be thin for him or any other person who wants unlimited people.  
19. [welfare] We would be the first to make such charitable ethos, but I have not seen such stubborn machinery or such missiles anywhere in Pakistan, so I think the government is not capable of running anything this year.  
20. [governance] I know I am bringing down the government here, it cannot run, it will be stuck there, it will become an incarnation of government where medicine will never be available, there will never be a doctor, Dr. Shahrukh Khan and our sisters, women nurses, but medical is the crown of our cities for me.  
21. [healthcare] He is the one who has dedicated his time to the search for humanity, but the way you have been defeated by Doctor Saheb in every section of the Master, it is not a medical thing to go to Aaj Tak, it is a political field, even if it is bureaucracy now.  
22.

23. [action] I went there myself to Vardhast Lal and then handed over the arrest history to him.  
24. [action] He used that branch in such a brilliant manner.  
25. [action] Listeners, during this time, when I called the leaders of the government of Punjab, please distribute one bottle, you do not handover it to them.  
26. [governance] I can do it, why do they have to force you, you have to give these pills, yes, it is true, I got angry at what I said that we are helpless in any medicine or machinery or any such item which is unpleasant.  
27. [governance] Where sacrifice will have to be made and from then on we will quietly give the contact award to the lowest bidder or to those who get the best machine.  
28. [policy] This is what I am talking about in the reverse order.  
29. [governance] What do you mean and I said that we are giving such details.  
30. [corruption] What he wants to give us in the name of a mistake is that at this time, it is only the expenditure of the government to run such institutions where medicines are given by the government and others let your feet grow.  
31. [corruption] So, if they wanted something from us, then where did the body come from?

93. [general] I will narrate with a stone that I met her after 4 years and I saw mine on television sometimes when I used to read newspapers, that the government which is now doing this work with them, people used to tell me that have you seen them, they have some fear of God, Bluetooth one.  
94. [governance] If a good person is willing to remove his hand from any government for doing good work, then what is the bad thing in it?  
95. [governance] What is the use of this phone?  
96. [general] When has this form been filled in it?  
97. [governance] If any government system does this to good people today, then there is something in it.  
98. [policy] There should not be any political color, whatever raw thing you have said, but I am saddened by the fact that the government had closed that egg in the previous regime, I am very saddened by this, I am very saddened by Ajay Devgan today, so now Bhaj Dadi, please listen to me.  
99. [policy] A  bill collection scheme which Chini Sahab started from one side in 2001 for unemployed people and as soon as he reached Rs 12 billion, for the last three and a half years, he has been using all kinds of essays, only he has spent all the money of Salman in the mosque.  
100. [corruption] They were given by sitting and there is not even a single person among them who has been given money in the name of politics and it was given by asking whether you belong to this clan and I will even make a special effort to release money for the employment scheme to Jeera and those who.  
101. [policy] You had promised in the Badshahi Masjid that it will be run in the whole of Pakistan, so Al Hamdulillah, now Allah Ta'ala has given you the opportunity to fulfill this promise, so you have given the application to run it in the whole of Pakistan also, Mansaan Love, I did this after 4 years, three-four I tried to meet them today, I did not tell them that I did not meet them through that government, but all the pictures that I got, I will come late today and put them in the box, it would seem that I and I had no style, tell me these things, I was definitely saddened by that, children.  
102. [welfare] What is the fault of the children, these three planets belong to the poor families, the Molu Kulhads, the white collar ones, the Hazrat sitting there has praised the white collar man for being subservient, and does not extend his hand to anyone, these are those people, there are lakhs of them.  
103. [finance] No, for them crores of rupees, to stop it today and put it in the eyes of politics is raw sir, you answer in written form, I also knew that this matter is like this, I agree with you 100 percent, that is why I also said in my speech yesterday.  
104. [general] I was there the day before yesterday in the Staff College, Kota, there I told the officers and soldiers what I had got the opportunity to do here and I want to remind this again today, the brand dialogue is also cool, now we have to add friends and talk.  
105. [governance] There will be all the stakeholders if we have to move this Pakistan forward and this Yorker you said that there should be no compromise on Sanat, Honey and Talim, I just agree with you Professor, the purpose of this Grand Dialogue is that that area.  
106. [policy] The system would have been more comprehensive if you had added the night along with the saint, but you have addressed the issue, there is also IT information technology and the world in which this basic thing is there, it can move forward a lot, that Grand Oil is now its.  
107. [governance] There is a need that if any government comes or goes, someone can control these areas and that country can move forward.  
108. [general] So, you have heard what I said, believe me, I do not want to talk about politics here.  
109. [governance] But with a sad heart I say without naming the government's PLI Pakistan Kidney Liver Institute which was built with twenty rupees and is not in the world's condition but has become a world's best where kidney and liver transplant and all their famous models are done.  
110. [welfare] To make the treatment free for the poor man, we did not complete it in our times, Khaja Salman and Bhiksha are sitting here, his team, the officers, the doctors, day and night, he is the Board of Governors, not his office, Dashrathji Chairman Mehul, when the government took him out.  
111. [governance] Throw, you insulted them and many of the staff who had come from America had no security when the great Pakistanis who were paying millions of dollars in salaries there left their own kind and broke all the relations here.  
112. [general] Why should we go to Pakistan and be unhappy?  
113. [welfare] Humanity, tea seller, public welfare, all these things, whether from Kota or Dera Ismail Khan, there was great emphasis here, there is a place where poor people are treated and in my 10 years, I have helped more than one billion poor people of Pakistan.  
114. [finance] Whose money is this used in dishonor and for the children, for the poor children and for the dead people whose kidneys had to be transplanted, this operation was not done in every house here, we had to send them to India and by tying them to our religion, India which is one of ours.  
115. [general] Death is our companion, but we are related to them, happiness is there for them, it used to go to China, it took our milk, I made a plan to replace it too, and according to many sources, yesterday it was Mayanath Dal, it became the subject of politics and did we live in it for 72 years?  
116. [general] After this, we have not learned our lessons and have to keep doing politics.  
117. [general] We have kept an eye on the politics of Coonoor, but they were their loss and they became straws for the poor farmers whose children, if they are not traders, then they go to their next place, earning a day's wages.  
118. [welfare] When the house itself was not consecrated and the kidney transplant did not happen, he went to the next place and his six children were left to the comments of his life but there was no one else to tire them, he left them to Allah and there was no confirmation path for them.  
119. [welfare] No, there will be thousands or lakhs of families who could not succeed in these 4 years, then this is such a big crime that we have committed a crime that could only be fatal.  
120. [governance] I think that the door should be closed whether someone comes or goes.  
121. [governance] Now we are on our own.  
122. [governance] You should have hands-on training, you should be a saint, you need someone, you should be the meat of marriage, no one should be allowed to do politics on this, it is absolutely true, but for this, we need a source, we need a big heart, we will spend our night but we have our 12.  
123. [welfare] It will be June, you will have to get rid of your likes and dislikes 12 times, you will have to kill your grandmother, for this, thousands of millions of children and elders have made great sacrifices for the progress and prosperity of this community, not because.  
124. [general] This country is our own knowledge, don't know God, we are getting all the earrings, that's why we were created not only in this week but in the whole world, with hard work, trust and Dayanand, our flag will be closed so much that it will not reach that well.  
125. [general] If we can, but it will not be like this, when we used the previous government for politics and now all the businessmen have been ruined, this much is certain, but it is our responsibility, if we have to change it, if we have to change the attitude, then only that and the fate.  
126. [general] Whatever one child says to change, then only follow whatever is sent by him.  
127. [finance] I am one third happy that you have entered here in India, you have not installed urban packing machine, this is the way to stay alive in life, there is no other way.  
128. [general] No, if the world was made of marble, then next to us it is said in Turkish that if from marble and path marble, what does marble say in Urdu that we do not walk with the office, it does not exist from the union where it is born that if with.  
129. [general] If one were to be born in heaven, then Pakistan would be the world's biggest nightmare, where marble exams are held later, in Karachi, in Lahore, in Peshawar, in Kota, there are women and today they themselves are craving for one day's bread.  
130. [finance] Today, the cat case, we had to do this page and increase the prices of petrol, it was our benefit when it was going on in that court in March.  
131. [general] Without going into politics, I want to say that the principal living on the loan will remain alive till then.  
132. [general] Not possible, you were absolutely right about the beauty, absolutely Quran Kareem orders it, absolutely Madhulika, the enjoyment of old cream, a man cannot think anything, that thing can be talked to the actor, you, him, but at this time, we should have been at the forefront in the world, Islamic block.  
133. [governance] What is our status on which we are now?  
134. [finance] Bangladesh, on which I am 90, wherever there is this burden of luck, there were no boards, there were no Bengali burden, they were presented with balls and they were told to save their lives, today their export is 40 rupees per share of ours.  
135. [general] The report is still sounding 27 28 off on this and if I can present examples, then take the time to say that the note is ₹ 2 opportunity tree.  
136. [general] Now I am the greatest storyteller of humans, but I swear to God, if we have to go ahead, then we have to use our.  
137. [welfare] For the sake of honor, we have to rise above the fire and for the sake of Tom, for the sake of the external and well-being of these crores of people, for the orphans and the glory and for the destitute, to strengthen the fame of Pakistan, including and to advance the training of doctors and nurses.  
138. [healthcare] What about providing hospitals, what about carrying forward the reforms, and Ulama-e-Karam and our doctors and our bureaucrats, abusive engineers are the same ma'am of all that if we set an example, then things will be successful, without that, it cannot progress, Ashrafi, if it is too much.  
139. [governance] That if you do everything for profit, then we have to reach there, then this country cannot run if we do this, we are forced to increase the prices sky high in the world, this is oil and its prices, we are our resistance to gas and we are like this.  
140. [finance] In the month of March, he dropped Kim, gave the reins to someone for three and a half years and gave you the program to replace him, we tried very hard but by placing one stone on another, we had to increase the prices and then fill it.  
141. [welfare] I want to tell you that God.  
142. [general] I swear, my life is in his possession, I will try my best to rally the poor people where this burden has been imposed, we have also given ₹ 2000 per month to those students for crime, we have given Utsav subsidy on oil and its petrol prices which are.

149. [general] Nandan has always been a home, a devotee of gas, is being imported in mobile, when gas was ₹ 3, 3 people had their own unit, today it has reached Chhattisgarh, if it is not made in this side, then it is made in a consolidation, through a planning, from Musabani and above that.  
150. [general] He should read something on which side he is bursting with requests from today.  
151. [general] Third, fill this picture carefully.

156. [finance] Use it and also include those people who are your relatives and those who have something to eat.  
157. [general] Mukesh has not got the hand of anyone Hazrat, this is it, it must be the old girlfriend, now Maulana Shah is sitting and has confirmed it, so this is prime.  
158. [governance] Minister about their expense and land, they will also shape them, now we will see help coming, I want to talk to you, it is very important for today's human being, this is what I am thinking day and night, first load shedding is happening, I know people of the plant.

162. [general] I told you yesterday, I said that this is a metro, it has done a lot in its last moments, this is a common man who has hidden a motor bike, he will get Rs. 2000, he will get his own fortune, there is an income support program, but till now you can taste it.  
163. [general] Here are your culprits, there you give him a metro ticket during peak hours so that he is a poor man, he should not be hosted by someone or they are doing some prank on us for us, I did the same for the off charity match yesterday.  
164. [general] The meeting took place for 5 hours and there will be a lot of noise about that too and the announcement will be made in a day or two and also I told the setting that I will not accept it in the above hours and after listening to it at all, I [ __ ] Rochelle for 2 hours.  
165. [general] The plans are there but the oil lady has lost, had to order gas, also had to call Tricolor which has gone to 120 developers, so if we don't think of oil and gas, when has the material been absorbed, your form balance will become a hot promise but load shedding will increase now its.  
166. [governance] The above merit has to be balanced, I am talking to you absolutely, it has to be balanced, then I said this, I formed a cabinet committee for a 5-hour meeting yesterday, there is no load for more than 2 hours, no problem, Nand Dega will definitely give in our village.  
167. [general] The engine will help us from somewhere and if the common man was the captain, he would be able to walk, if his body is so hot in India and Russia, after August, there is employment inflation and the mantra of shroud at night, he will go mad, if ever the heat is killing him, then this.  
168. [general] The modernity of our government and big alarms are present in the day.  
169. [general] The situation of actress Nargis is the duty of all of us.  
170. [action] If we come together and when we tweet, we will make it a no-go area, then I assure you, I am with you.

172. [general] I conclude, we can reach our destination even in the dark, we can reach our destination even in this darkness, we fireflies should remember the way, I can reach our destination even in the dark, we fireflies should remember the way, and the elders.  
173. [general] Children are being born due to oppression and atrocities.  
174. [general] Children are being born in the streets and markets.  
175. [governance] There should be al-Khubi intersections in the city that the reason behind the festival colors of Pakistan was that businessman Mohammad Shahbaz Sharif and Hospital, Lahore, was removed from his history.  
176.

2024-03-20 00:00:00,Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif Addresses Cabinet Meeting Today  - 20-03-2024,"

[general]  Bismillah Rehman Rahim, today this is the first regular meeting of the Cabinet. [general] I congratulate all the capable dignitaries and government officials. [general]  And I hope that Insha Allah, this Cabinet will show confidence in the people of Pakistan by quoting its responsibility and responsibility. [welfare] But Inshallah, with our hard work and Shabana's daily prayer, today first of all we pay tribute to our sons and their wonderful parents and take our food for granted, whose sons fought the terror with great courage and bravery a few days ago and who All the terrorists were sent to hell and martyred along with them. [army] I think that there is no greater example of love, sacrifice and sacrifice for the country than this. [general] I think that an example cannot be given. [action] I would first of all request Aasan Iqbal Sahib that There is no doubt that terrorism within Pakistan, which raised its head 10, 15, 20 years ago, was completely eradicated as a result of immense sacrifices and in my mind. [law and order] It is believed that in this era of Asare Hajar, perhaps there is no other example of this in the world and about 70 8 thousand Pakistanis offered their lives in which the soldiers of Pakistan, officers and soldiers, their children, police officers and soldiers, their children, law enforcement agencies, common Pakistanis, all four. [welfare] The Pakistanis who settled in the provinces, those doctors, mothers, children, Talibs, Ilams, Ustads, Engineers, Doctors, Lawyers, i.e. the sons of every glory of life, took part in this sacrifice and it was completely wiped out. [law and order] Unfortunately, again a few years ago, it raised its head, I am in its hands. [action] It is not going to happen at this time but the reality is that after so many sacrifices and huge expenditure of money and business, the return of this terrorism is no less than any tragedy. [action] Now it is up to us to crush its head again. [army] Shaheed and Ghazi are fighting them risking their lives. [welfare] A few days ago, I went to meet the parents and family members of Left Colonel Syed Kashif Shaheed and Captain Ahmed Badar Shaheed. [people] Believe me, their courage refreshed my faith. [welfare] The father of both of them, Grami Apna Lakhat Jagar, who had left this world, was in great spirits and Captain Ahmed Babar's father himself is a retired army man. [people] He told me that Shahbaz Sharif is my only son, a 23-year-old captain and has four sisters, so Allah. [people] He gave me a son, Allah took it back, or I am his trust, I have completely bowed my head at his pleasure, he is Allah, everything belongs to him, but I am very proud of the great sacrifice my son has made for the country. [people] And my daughters were sitting here and their parents were also there. [general] I saw the courage of that child. [welfare] Believe me, my faith was refreshed when I saw it. [action] But he said one thing that Wazir Azam should completely end this terror, so I believed him. [action] He assured them that Insha Allah, the government of Pakistan and the Pakistan Army together have full determination to end it and Insha Allah, it will happen again and along with this I assured them that this terrorism which is happening from across the border, we will now defeat it. [law and order] We cannot tolerate this. [governance] Pakistan's borders are the red line against terrorism and we want to live in an environment of complete peace with our neighbor brother Mubarak and we want to live in a very good way. [cooperation] We want to increase the relations, but if unfortunately the land of our neighboring country is used for terrorism, then it is no longer acceptable and this should remain very important that we will not tolerate any kind of terrorism from across the border under no circumstances. [action] Along with this, I would like to request all our brothers and sisters to come together and prepare a plan against terrorism, after which we will work together with seriousness and with high sincerity of purpose, then this will I believe that no one else can be held responsible for the eradication of poverty and unemployment, to establish peace in a better future. [cooperation] I hope that our neighboring countries will accept my suggestion because of the efforts made by them in this context. [cooperation] Take the proposal forward and inshallah together we will make Khata a cradle of peace. [finance] Naal Member, we will take you into confidence about the discussions that took place with the IMF and now Nab Finance Minister, but it should be kept in mind that during the previous government, we had taken Pakistan to task. [finance] To save Pakistan which was very close to bankruptcy, we used all our Islamic wisdom and also spent our political capital, which I never regretted and never will and will not do so because if the State of Pakistan is saved. [finance] So if the princely state is saved then politics will also be saved Inshallah, now again the IMF team has come, maybe today it will go for second and last review and now Finance Mist will tell about it but in future also we need a new program and not with happiness. [finance] Due to the compulsion that we have to restore our old foundation, we have to make it stand on its feet and we have to free ourselves from debt. [finance] Today I assure you this firm and through this firm the entire community that as many as I have till now Also, in my meeting with my brother Mu Malik and friend Mu Malik, who is the ambassador, I requested him very politely but in a casual manner that now we will work with you, be it any field, information technology or mines and minerals. [development] Sati is our Idaar, this is the export zone, this is the industrial zone, these are the areas where Inshallah we will be bankable, we will make a proposal and present it to you, Inshallah very soon, the work on it has started. [development] In Maji too, when we had 16 months of government, SI FC. [development] We did a lot of work through this and a lot of work was done in this term period also but now Inshallah this new government has come, so with the new mandate Insha Allah we will work on it, so I told them that these are roll overs of loans and fixed loans. [finance] It has caused immense loss to Pakistan and it is our conscious decision that now we will try our best to avoid taking huge loans, at least in this case where we have no other source of livelihood other than that and gradually, Inshallah, we will save ourselves from debt. [finance] We will get rid of it and the only way to do that is to make the environment of Pakistan favorable for the investment that we bring, whether it is our political environment, it is a friendly environment and to create a community within Pakistan and for that, our previous offer was definitely Charter of Economy in the Parliament, after that, along with that, we should present the idea of ​​'Yag Jaiti' which I have requested today that together we will get rid of Pakistan as a challenger. [development] Both 'Yag Jaiti' and 'Mashi Prakashi' are inseparable, so for this Inshallah, work is being done on this with great speed and today I want to state two or three things here that the first thing is that our dues worth Rs. 2400 billion are currently in the hands of the Tribal Council or with the Tribal Council. [finance] Are they in the courts and their cases are pending, amounting to Rs 2400 billion i.e. two trillion and 400 billion rupees? [governance] I requested Lom Saab to please hold a meeting with these tribals and ask them to take a decision on the basis of justice as soon as possible. [governance] In this way, I, in the service of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, tell the Mutmarna High Court and tell him that all the cases pending before the judges should be decided on their merits as soon as possible so that we know which ones. [governance] What are the issues which are to come in the government treasury and what are the issues which have been decided by the courts. [governance] Apart from this, I understand that I will work fully on this along with the Law Minister. [governance] And if I take notice of the Chief Justice of Pakistan's heartfelt duty, then it will be a huge contribution for Pakistan. [governance] Secondly, I want to make this point absolutely clear today. [governance] Tomorrow, Alhamdulillah, I have taken the final meeting and the decision to digitize the FBR 100 percent. [governance] For 100 percent i.e. almost complete intervention of human hands, their intervention will almost end. [governance] I have held the last meeting yesterday for digitization. [governance] On 8th April, Inshallah, the beds of those consultants will come. [governance] World class consultants and those consultants whom Pakistan For example, they should not only be well aware of the ground reality of our country, but they should also have a lot of work experience in such progressing countries. [governance] This is the term of reference for the consultant. [governance] Inshallah, his bed is on 8th April. [governance] The application will open and it will take a week for Majeed to see him properly, so inshaallah in the third and fourth week of April, Consultants Appointments will not be built overnight, this will not happen overnight, it will take time and I promise to this community inshaallah that To fulfill this great responsibility, Nabal along with Finance Minister Saheb and other colleagues will inshallah supervise it and will complete this program as soon as possible. [governance] How much time will it take? [general] What time do the consultants give? [general] I will inshallah that next month. [governance] When I come, I will present it before this cabinet and in this way, first of all, there are cases of tax of Rs 2400 billion in the courts and in the tribunal, apart from this, the billions and trillions of rupees which belong to the treasury are being eaten up annually by our mafia. [corruption] And there are billions of dollars deposited in safe havens in the outside world, there is no one to ask for that, I requested the Wazir Khazanah Sahib and I myself have held not one but three or four meetings with the Chairman FBR to make a list of such officers who Inshallah, I will call them in the next few days and give them public recognition in front of the entire community and those who have played a very terrible role in this mess will not be spared and action will be taken against them. [corruption] So that the practice of Jaja and punishment should come into existence immediately and until this entire system is digitized, in the meantime, Inshallah, we should recover it annually so that the treasury of this community will increase in it and this We are living a life of debt day and night, it will get worse and it will keep on decreasing. [finance] In this context, the third thing that I want to do is that Shahana Rajjaat Hai Pakistan, I have formed a committee for this, how can we reduce the debt of the government of Pakistan. [finance] And it is very necessary to reduce it. [finance] Let me tell you that in many areas there are those who are not needed and in the 18th amendment, through development, in many areas they have gone to the states and some are stuck, under that we should hand them over to the states and apart from this Moreover, wherever there can be reduction in the bad habits, it should be brought about. [governance] Inshallah, we are fully committed for that. [general] Inshallah, the report of this committee will come and we will immediately implement it on its recommendation when the Cabinet There will be a full debate on it and inshallah it will not take much time. [general] Similarly, I have already told you that theft of electricity is a theft of Rs 400-500 billion per year. [corruption] Similarly, on our other petroleum side, gas is also stolen there. [corruption] Here the noble minister has mentioned both petroleum and power. [general] I have told him in big words in his service that you will have to bring a fill for plan and completely end the theft of electricity and gas and I am speaking with utmost sincerity but with confidence. [action] I want to say with this that any recommendation or resistance of any kind in this regard will not be accepted in this way and if we do not do these things then what will the treasury do to fill its treasury, these are the areas where The treasury will be filled the way I talked about FBR, the way I talked about power, the way I talked about gas and whatever other ways, if the condition of Pakistan is ignored then there will be zero tolerance for it and I What to say it without any favor even if I have to pay the price I will pay the price but will be no more to this theft and pain [action] This thing should definitely remain in the mind and this is I had said it last time also today say it again [general] Here we perform or perish, it does or dies. [general] In this context, I would like to submit that since this is a split mandate, the Jamaat in Wafa that is in this coalition is its reflection in this cabinet, its entire presence is present here in the same way. [governance] Our various political parties in the states have been given mandates by the people, hence in view of this, we will have to fulfill this responsibility together, loyalty and all the states together, loyalty alone cannot meet this great challenge without the support of the states. [cooperation] We will have to meet this challenge together, that is why I will also hold regular meetings with Subai Vajra Aala and Subai Hukum, that in this great task, we will help in building Pakistan and in giving Pakistan the status of Mumtaz in one world. [governance] Wafat and all the four units will have to work together day and night on this and will have to contribute their full share in it. [governance] I think I would like to conclude by saying one or two more things. [general] We should also start talks with them for the next program of IMF. [finance] And they are saying very loudly that you have to increase the tax base, which is counter productive anyway, imposing heavy taxes on people who are already paying taxes, so increasing the tax base is a fundamental responsibility and this is what I have just said. [finance] That IMF is not ready to accept that sir, you will bring back what is being stolen and embezzled from you and you should offset it. [corruption] You tell us how much of what happened in Maji can be attributed to that and how much now. [general] Time will prove to what extent our implementation is successful but increasing the tax base is both a mandatory condition and a requirement and for that we definitely have to talk to them and those areas which have billions. [finance] They do business but they don't have any banking transaction anywhere in FBR, there is no trace of them there and they don't give any information and Shahana that we have to completely eliminate this elite capture and for that we have done a lot of talking. [corruption] And on top of that, Inshallah, we will bring it properly and then we have to go to the Parliament, we will have a dialogue with the Parliament along with our united people and we will bring all the legal instruments that we have. [governance] The last thing I want to say is that all those who Our travelers have come from Europe, China, America, the Middle East, that we have shamed the system of one window operation created by the previous government, that system is a big, powerful, red tape, it has all the fuss and all the inefficiencies. [governance] It is their end and Inshallah, together we will make it successful. [cooperation] For this, I believe that we will have to move forward in this field with all our spirit and needle. [general] With these words, I thank you all and I am proud of you that You all have come together to support me in the mission, you have supported yourself and supported the community, thank you very much. [general]"

[action] My brothers and elders, I want to say that I will not in my life cause more devastation than this in the whole of Pakistan, whatever size it is, you all know that the previous government told us how much destruction it caused that today there is no chance to go into its details.  
[policy] Because today you have to accept the politics and we have to fulfill the duty of ending the vote, we have to bow down to the rule of loyalty, the dying man was telling me in a helicopter that instead of giving programs to the people, I said.  
[finance] That the whole world knows that this is known to be the government, I have just filled in the words, don't wash the rest of the spices, first Rs. 28 people have to come to every house which has been freed from flood for tux, in the whole of Pakistan that Rs.

[general] What happens to these winds, there is no compulsion to come to that house.  
[governance] We went that I have to live in the world and there is a need in the world and for the loot of today's treatment and education, arrangements have been made for those children.  
[development] Apart from this, crops grown on millions of acres in Pakistan and especially in rice, cotton, the date palm has been destroyed to the extent that the seeds are present here in the areas of this zoo or in the stomach where it has been destroyed to the extent possible.

[army] I am here.  
[development] I have just seen Sakur Bridge, which is the second time that a warship has been washed away by water and I was very happy to hear that the commander of the Pakistani Army, General Qamar Javed, had brought the BJP secretary for the last four days and has given a cold to the people here.  
[action] If a Bailey bridge is to be built, I am very happy to meet our engineering corps which is making it very very tough and I think that it should work very fast and very well.  
[governance] Similarly, whose minister is below.  
[general] Sir, Maulana Abdul Rehman Saheb is sitting in front of me, he and his entire team, from Secretary to AJ and Chairman, are working day and night and I have the greatest respect for them.

[policy] You say brother, by consuming it daily, I had requested Meena that whether that broken tree, now the road is made of glass, it is the morning of the Puranas or that you should not indulge in the rituals of desire and this is my court in the whole of Pakistan that you.  
[action] You work together with morning rule and morning characters and I like a lot about this easy spread, Rahman Sahab and the factory manager and his technique in this is very wonderful, that boy is working and he has done a wonderful job in Balochistan and.

[action] Hamdullah, this work is conducted by Chandra Roy, please complete it.  
[development] It will happen but I want to say that right now the water is descending here, water is present even in winter, so Baba, this is the secret of the water which is our friend, now we need it in this challenge, it has been written to me that this is a traitor.  
[general] The second I saw mercy, it is a city, so this is a new chain, it is looking into our eyes that right now our brother and six lakh women, our daughters come, that he is present in these areas, the day is his land, which is the case.  
[welfare] This medicine will solve the problem of Rs. 600003, that the mothers and daughters of our community, providing clean water in this manner, repopulating the houses, this is a work worth billions or trillions of rupees and which our friends and uncles see, our big ones.  
[cooperation] The people of religion are definitely taking care of us in Ahmedabad at this time and I want to thank them every day and also for the use, but this challenge is very big, very big, for this we have to trust even a single penny to the deserving people in their footsteps.  
[corruption] There is no compromise on this, neither the Muslims nor the Muslims, but neither in the People's Party nor in Hawaii, and in all the political parties, and I will not tolerate it being said that even a single penny anywhere, through any means, goes to anyone without seeing this.  
[action] If her murder reaches her and she gets what she deserves, she will be given that beautiful place, Inshallah, so this mark is that we are making a mistake from a human being to a shop, so maybe when we are not successful, if we are 99 percent successful in this, then it is very good for the actress.  
[general] There will be a big reward, so today I want to thank all of you, my brothers are sitting here in Dera Ismail Khan and the first one in Torque is 209, based on two firms, which will have two rooms, there are two rooms and dates in it.

[general] My elder brothers and my young friends, we have started this from the back of Virat and one main teacher is Allah Taala, He is the person who has established Guru Parv and is doing this in the house and then when that house is built.  
[general] When I go, I will take Hazrat Maulana with me and I will take all my friends to the rich place and to the People's Party and to the festival and then we will see if that model is successful then will we come to the whole of Pakistan this year or will it be our own?  
[general] Can bear the heat and can fulfill all the needs, then for that we will move ahead in the same manner that we have to give money to the millions of houses which have been razed to the ground, we just have to provide oil, now we will do this.  
[general] You are thinking that the servant of Allah has provided me this house but I understand the rule and I am doing it bigger than you here.  
[general] Ask Dera Ismail Khan that I am MS Word, will I run away and let's meet in the morning and we will talk about something different.  
[general] Is this question whether the houses should be given in cash or houses should be given by building them?  
[general] I am still unable to find the matching condition in my mind.  
[general] There are good and bad things in it.  
[general] The good thing is that if the houses are built, then the people will go to those houses.  
[development] We will get settled and will build it ourselves, I don't know from where will we get the bricks and mud from the house, one bad thing is the expenditure on it, maybe if we have got some government job, then in this matter, I am still in my mind day and night, the answer to this is that we are installers.  
[action] We will do justice to Mahesh Bhatt, I am here where were the boys, where did the truck or Pradeep go and a man of God, the sun has gone here, Pakistan is now trying its best for this, I have just talked about breaking the record and winning.  
[action] That too, I and you will request Ajit to please try the mosque and perhaps find that dead body so that his family members can be relieved that his dead body has been found, so this is a big challenge and apart from this, other matters which have been stated here, now after the filling of Jamjohan Chhote Dam, Hazrat has said a very important thing while meeting the deceased that this is a flood, it is not a river flood, this rain is bad and generally there is silence.  
[development] Special preparations are being made to buy from Bengal, Bengal has a free hand, then it comes to Indus Valley via Kashmir and corruption in Pakistan and it comes to Punjab, I have my teams in other areas and the question is this is just this conversation, flood came rain.  
[corruption] This is completely unique, there is no example of it before and it has come in this year, it has not come from there, from Kashmir, it has been false to Malkheda since those days, there they created havoc there, it has happened in a day in the year 364, the biggest time in the date.  
[development] But this destruction used to have a face, it has come in a new way, for this we will have to stop the plan of Mustaqbil, for this we will have to make both of them a lie, we will have to prepare for this in the difficult areas, we will have to prepare for this.  
[development] It will happen because it has destroyed the crops, it has destroyed the houses, it has destroyed this dam, it has destroyed everything, it has destroyed Mahesh, God forbid, there can be an increase and if we stand on that oil, then Allah Taala Inshah Allah we.  
[general] Let us do our harvest on everything, the last thing I want to say is that you should not worry about all the governments, all the drugs, all the crimes, I am thankful to everyone from the bottom of my heart and here in Dera Ghazi Dera Ismail Khan.  
[governance] O'clock, the medicine Mashallah is playing its full role, I am sitting with that deer seeker and other companions are sitting, I salute all of you, you are working day and night to interfere in the fields, so please accept this.  
[general] Say and make for you both the religion and the world for you.  
[action] I want to make the last commitment that with patience, we will work with you till the last breath, till the last eclipse, you will be in your home after half Nivedita, we will not leave you alone but it will take time.  
[general] There will be no more night, I am roaming around with my comrades day and night, this is not a favor, this is my duty, this is my responsibility, tell me, as a Muslim, as a Pakistani, we bow down to a mantra for such charity.
